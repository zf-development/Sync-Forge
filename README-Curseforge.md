[Sync (Forge)](https://github.com/zf-development/Sync-Forge) is a fork of [Sync-Forge by VTSumik](https://github.com/VTSumik/Sync-Forge), which is a Forge port of an [unofficial port](https://github.com/pawjwp/sync-fabric) of an [unofficial port](https://modrinth.com/mod/sync-fabric-reported) of an [unofficial reimplementation](https://modrinth.com/mod/sync-fabric) of the original [Sync](https://github.com/iChun/Sync) mod, originally developed by [iChun](https://github.com/iChun). This mod is used in the [Desolate Planet](https://modrinth.com/modpack/desolate-planet) modpack and fixes some significant bugs with the other versions.

The original description says it all:

Sync provides clones, or as we like to call it, "shells". These shells are basically a new individual, with their own inventory, experience level, and even gamemode.

However, what they lack, is a mind to control them. That’s where the player comes in. Each shell is biometrically tied to the player who’s sample is used to create it, and will allow the player to "sync" their mind to the other shell, essentially creating multiple player instances.

(The Curseforge description doesn't support all the markdown options that other platforms do, see the description on [Github](https://github.com/zf-development/Sync-Forge) for the best representation.)

## How to play

- You need to craft a `shell constructor` and place it down.
- Then you need to provide it with a genetic sample (just `right-click` it).\
 **⚠️WARNING: with the default config, this action will KILL you!** In order to create a shell with full health, the constructor must absorb 20HP *(40 for Hardcore players)*. If you don't want to die, you can eat a golden apple to increase your maximum health, or you can hold a totem of undying during the process *(which is the only option for Hardcore players)*.
- The shell constructor needs power to work, so put a `treadmill` next to it *(it should touch any side of any part of the shell constructor)* and lure a `pig` or a `wolf` to its center to start generating piggawatts.\
 You should end up with something like this:
 ![Example of working shell constructor](https://github.com/zf-development/Sync-Forge/raw/main/media/shell_constructor-showcase.png)\
(You don't really need a comparator, it's here just to demonstrate that you can determine progress of the shell construction process via strength of the comparator output.)
- Once your new shell is constructed, you need to craft a `shell storage` and place it down.
- Supply it with `redstone power`.
- Once doors of the shell storage are open, you can `walk into it`.
- You'll see a radial `menu` that displays your shells:
 ![Menu example](https://github.com/zf-development/Sync-Forge/raw/main/media/menu-showcase.png)
- `Select` the shell you want to transfer your mind into, and enjoy the process!

 ## Notes

  - You can color-code shells stored in shell storages. Just right-click a shell storage with dye.
  - Syncing works cross dimensional, and should support custom dimensions.
  - If you die while using a shell, you'll be immediately synced with your original body *(if you still have one; otherwise your mind will be transferred to a random shell)*.
  - Death of a shell doesn't increase your death counter.
  - Shell can be equipped (or unequipped) with armor, tools, etc. via hoppers connected to a corresponding shell container.
  - Shell storage should be constantly supplied with power in order to keep stored shell alive (configurable).
   - Shell storage can be powered by redstone, if the `shellStorageAcceptsRedstone` option is set to `true`.
   - Shell storage can be powered by any valid energy source (e.g., treadmills, machinery from popular tech mods, etc.).
  - It's possible to measure a shell container's state with a comparator.
   - You can determine progress of the shell construction process via strength of the comparator output.
   - You can measure the fullness of a shell's inventory via strength of the comparator output.
   - You can change a comparator output type by right-clicking on a shell container with a wrench.
  - Shell storage and shell constructor are pretty fragile, so don't try to mine them without `silk touch` enchantment.

## Config

The mod is highly configurable. The config is located at `./config/sync-common.toml` by default looks like this:

```
